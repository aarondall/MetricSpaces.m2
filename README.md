# MetricSpaces.m2
Macaulay2 methods for computing with metric spaces from graphs

## Summary
We provide a few methods for computing metric generating sets and bases for finite metric spaces. One can also test if the metric bases of finite metric are the bases of a matroid. 

## Dependencies

[Macaulay2](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2) must be installed. Also, the [Matroids](https://github.com/jchen419/Matroids-M2) package must be installed separately.
